//! High performance XML reader/writer.
//!
//! # Description
//!
//! quick-xml contains two modes of operation:
//!
//! A streaming API based on the [StAX] model. This is suited for larger XML documents which
//! cannot completely read into memory at once.
//!
//! The user has to explicitly _ask_ for the next XML event, similar to a database cursor.
//! This is achieved by the following two structs:
//!
//! - [`XmlReader`]: A high level XML pull-reader which resolves entities and can process several
//!   XML sources if you provide them.
//! - [`Reader`]: A low level XML pull-reader where buffer allocation/clearing is left to user.
//! - [`Writer`]: A XML writer. Can be nested with readers if you want to transform XMLs.
//!
//! Especially for nested XML elements, the user must keep track _where_ (how deep)
//! in the XML document the current event is located.
//!
//! quick-xml contains optional support of asynchronous reading and writing using [tokio].
//! To get it enable the [`async-tokio`](#async-tokio) feature.
//!
//! Furthermore, quick-xml also contains optional [Serde] support to directly
//! serialize and deserialize from structs, without having to deal with the XML events.
//! To get it enable the [`serialize`](#serialize) feature. Read more about mapping Rust types
//! to XML in the documentation of [`de`] module. Also check [`serde_helpers`]
//! module.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! - For a reading example see [`XmlReader`]
//! - For a low-level reading example see [`Reader`]
//! - For a writing example see [`Writer`]
